            <h5>
                <center> Overview
            </h5>
            </center>
        </p>



        <p>Fashion and dressing up is never easy for everyone. Some have good eyes on fashion and immediately know what to wear while others just grab the first thing they can get from their wardrobe, and the other bunch spends so much time thinking on what to wear. As a group we propose to help solve this issue faced by many in day to day basis. The solution we arrived to as a group is building a fashion application that suggests daily outfit recommendation basing on weather, location and type of events required. The result we aim to obtain is to lessen the hours spend by users in choosing their outfits. As a group, we hope to see our app users spend more valuable activities of their time rather than spending it worrying what to wear or feeling insecure and unsure of their outfits.
        </p>

        <p>
            According to The Telegraph, a recent study found that the average woman, in the course of her lifetime, spends almost one year standing in front of her closet deciding what to wear. This is why our group came up with a fashion app for a solution. It will reduce the ladies wasted hours on deciding what to wear because the app will suggest daily outfits according to weather, location and event. The user does not have to actively sort out her clothes or match them by colors, as the app will actively perform this itself. The main tasks user has to take is to upload their collection of clothes through scanning the barcodes on the dress’s tags when newly bought or scan the existing clothes they have in their wardrobe. As of present there are only three available useful fashion planning/solutions applications in the market today. These three applications contains some of the similar features we propose. These apps are ClosetSpace, GlamourOutfit and YourCloset.
        </p>
        <p>
            ClosetSpace is similar to our proposed project as it offers the same function of recommending outfits according to the weather, but does not allow the user to choose location and gather outfit suggestions according to that. This app is also accessible through computer and phone. Then, GlamourOutfit another fashion app that allows user to select the type of event, weather and other details the user will provide and then suggests an outfit. However, it requires hours to process outfit recommendations which means users has to input their requests day before their planned events. Lastly, YourCloset, it has many features including virtual closet, outfits and clothes photos/files are also backed up in Google and only accessible in Android phones. YourCloset allows users to plan everyday outfit in calendar, but similar to ClosetSpace, users has to actively spend time on choosing and matching their outfits in the app. It does not actively suggest or recommend any outfits. All these apps have its ups and downs which gave our project the winning edge to be different.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our proposed fashion application is consist of the combined special features of the 3 comparative apps in the market. ‘Noting to Wear’ our fashion application has advantageous features such us, daily outfit recommendation according to weather, location and event – allowing users to plan everyday outfit in calendar with little to less effort by just uploading their collection of clothes through scanning the barcodes/QR codes that comes with the clothes when they users newly purchased it, or scanning the actual clothes themselves. Unlike the combination of 3 similar applications available in the market, we are offering an alternative that is less time consuming, available on the go and help users in reducing their time deciding what to wear.

        <p>
            Our group aims to finish the project within the scheduled timetable, with the same level of quality, within the specified guidelines and hoping to do the best we can with the time we have been given.
            As for our proposed application, by the end of this of this semester we aim to compose a layout of our application in Figma and successfully show how the proposed application should look like. By completing this objective we hope to distribute another survey to confirm the potential consumers’ needs and from there, we will build our application more suitable to users’ taste and needs.

        <p>
            The project idea that the group came up with was a combination of all ideas presented by each member. Catherine’s and Jack’s idea revolved around interactive maps, while Shashika revolved around the fashion industry. So, the group came up with the idea of a fashion app which you can program based on your location and weather (interactive map – Jack and Catherine), then suggesting what appropriate styles and clothes (fashion – Shashika) the user should wear. Initially, the group bounced other couple of ideas – Catherine thought of an interactive safety map, which aims to be used by developers and local councils in improving their shared spaces in accordance to public’s feedback and ensuring the safety of their people. Jack also introduced the idea of having a map that would keep track of people’s location movements in order to help minimize the spread of the virus. This app aims to collect people's location information to identify the hotspots and warn users on their intended travels. However, as we know, shortly after we have discussed this, the government introduced the Covid-Safe app and other similar mobile applications have surfaced. Unfortunately, we could not think of additional features to make our idea stand out. 
</p>
<p>
    So, we decided on fashion, as that is where the money usually flows. We also had another hurdle, Bank joined our group later and we have missed his idea, by the time he joined our group we already settled on the fashion idea. But even so, Bank was very helpful and knowledgeable in enhancing our project idea. Based on the feedbacks gathered from the tutor and lecturer, it was confirmed that the project idea we came up as a group was great and from the researches done by each members, it could even have opportunity to sell in the market as there are only limited application of the same sort is offered and are not even as helpful as we proposed. 
             </p>

<p>
    As a group working collaboratively on this project, we have agreed to divide the parts and work on it on a weekly basis. To successfully conduct this assignment, we communicated hugely using Microsoft teams, we also made a Google document which is available for every group member to view and edit or add their parts. Then, for each week, each member is also assigned with a part and has one week to complete it. The group then conducts a meeting to discuss each part and the possible solutions or ideas that should be included in those areas, collaboratively and as a group. When each member is satisfied and has fully understood the information and the standard of ideas required for their part, they then work individually and complete their assigned part and submit it every end of the week and post in the group feed for feedback.
</p>

<p>
    For the first week, the tasks agreed to be completed on was the Timeline, Tools, Risks, Roles and Testing. It was fair to say that most members have done a good job completing their assigned tasks. Communication was also great, and everyone was very helpful when one has questions or requires additional help in completing their parts. Then, comes week two, the group has to complete Skills and Jobs, Scopes and Limits, Overview, Aims, Tools and Technologies, Plans and Progress, and Group process and career plans. This was a busy week for the team, but as intended, the group had a meeting first agreed on what the information are required for each part then, separate to work independently on them. It was quite challenging for some and did not complete their parts on the date agreed. Third week comes, communication was at it least, the team only communicated during the set meeting, it may be assumed that the team was busy working on each of their assigned tasks. The team also did not meet their deadlines; however, in the end it was still completed. Overall, the process of completing the project was a good experience for the team to learn and know more about each other.

            <h5>
                <center> Roles
            </h5>
            </center>
        </p>
        <p><b>Lead Developer</b></p>
        <p>A lead developer has the specific abilities and skills,
            but the most important is the lead developer can act as a leader of the whole project who can mentor, provide general design guidance and encourage the team to exchange ideas in the product’s development stages.
            Which we suggest <b>Catherine</b> to be the lead developer, because she is an amazing leader in our group who guides us to achieve our goals with her organization and leadership skills.
            A lead developer needs someone like her that not only can enhance the internal cohesion in the team, but also improve the efficiency of teamwork. It is no doubt that Catherine is the best member of our group to be the lead developer of the project.
        </p>

        <p><b>Application Developer</b></p>
        <p>As the name suggests, an application developer is someone who creates and tests the applications designed for the project.
            What an application developer needs is good at coding and following the suggestion of the lead developer.
            Therefore, <b>Jack</b> is the one that is able to handle this job. For the reason that Jack tends to be quiet most of the time, but he still delivers up to standard work output.
            He is a flexible person who has a good view on what he is doing. Jack is someone who is capable of overcoming difficulties and solving problems silently and efficiently.
            The position of application developer also gives him a great chance to show his talent of coding.
        </p>

        <p><b>Cyber Security Expert</b></p>
        <p>A cyber security expert is a person who protects the data of our project. Because we are living in the big data era, it is becoming more and more important to protect user data from disclosure.
            A cyber security expert will be able to provide solutions with security issues which will improve the productivity of members in the project and also attract more users.
            <b>Shashika</b> is the person who we assigned for this role. The reason why we chose her to be the cyber security expert is because she is good at this domain of cyber security and her ideal job is to employ in the cyber security field.
            And so she is able to assist users in providing a safe and secure environment.
        </p>

        <p><b>User Interface Designer</b></p>
        <p>User interface is significant because it gives the first impression on the user, it is the key factor of whether the user will continue to use the application or not.
            UI design focuses on the user's visual experience, flexibility and efficiency of use and aesthetics and minimalist design.
            The assignee of this role is <b>Bank</b>. Although his dream job is cloud engineer, he still has interest in designing staff.
            He uses many mobile and PC applications, which gives him some experience of UI design. And also Bank is learning User-centred Design that may make a big difference on designing user interface for this project application.

            Our product is aiming to help people find what to wear fashionably in their daily lives, so the wear suggestions given are principal activities in this project. Our product is offered to the general public of all ages, and every one of them has their own appetite for fashion choices. The thing we should test is whether our product’s fashion sense caters to different users ‘tastes. To find out whether we are building the right product, the user’s satisfaction degree to the wear suggestions is what we need to test. Hence, there is a user testing plan.

        <p>



            Risks are the facts that discourages a project where the team members must face and overcome it. Decisions make risks more powerful and sometimes avoid them without any problem. Developing an application is not an easy task but not a task which we cannot achieve with right products and people. Unfortunately, there are some risks that we will have to face while developing our project as team members.



        </p>



        <p>



            Biggest risk of developing applications is the targeted users who does not want the application. If the chosen target user group refuses the app, it will be the biggest risk that can happen to a project. To avoid this risk, we should consider more about our targeted users and see from their perspective. It will attract the targeted user group to the app and the app will satisfy them gaining more users.



        </p>



        <p>



            Choosing the app developer is another risk for the app as this decision will impact the whole project itself. Wrong App Developer can ruin whole project in a minute, and it will be a disaster to face as a team who are developing an application. We should consider more about the quality of the work of the App developer before choosing him for the project and we should not rely on cost more at this stage.



        </p>



        <p>



            Risk of data security should overcome by enhancing more security strategies such as OpenID Connect, Oauth2 for safe logins. Also, encryption systems and security layers should be implemented to secure the users while using the application. App integration, Anti debugging will help more to secure the data of the app users for the developers when they develop the application.



        </p>

        </p>

        <p>
            In order to capture communication that isn’t recorded formally, a better way is to record all voice messages and text messages, which can be used to form up Fill out a form of meeting minutes.
            And also make sure everyone in the team has contributed in meetings such as exchanging ideas on certain parts of the project.
            As usual, meetings will take place in Microsoft Team every Thursday or Friday.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, if a group member does not respond to communications, we will send a direct message to this member asking him what he is doing and whether he is available to come and join the meeting or not.
            The frequency of our team meeting is maintained at twice a week outside class times, sometimes three or four times a week is not impossible.
            Because we are a team with four members, it is important to exchange ideas, help each other when someone gets into trouble and complete the assignment together.
