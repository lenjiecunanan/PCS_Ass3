                <center> Overview
            </h5>

        <p>Fashion and dressing up is never easy for everyone. Some have good eyes on fashion and immediately know what to wear while others just grab the first thing they can get from their wardrobe, and the other bunch spends so much time thinking on what to wear. As a group we propose to help solve this issue faced by many in day to day basis. The solution we arrived to as a group is building a fashion application that suggests daily outfit recommendation basing on weather, location and type of events required. The result we aim to obtain is to lessen the hours spend by users in choosing their outfits. As a group, we hope to see our app users spend more valuable activities of their time rather than spending it worrying what to wear or feeling insecure and unsure of their outfits.
        </p>

        <p>
            According to The Telegraph, a recent study found that the average woman, in the course of her lifetime, spends almost one year standing in front of her closet deciding what to wear. This is why our group came up with a fashion app for a solution. It will reduce the ladies wasted hours on deciding what to wear because the app will suggest daily outfits according to weather, location and event. The user does not have to actively sort out her clothes or match them by colors, as the app will actively perform this itself. The main tasks user has to take is to upload their collection of clothes through scanning the barcodes on the dress’s tags when newly bought or scan the existing clothes they have in their wardrobe. As of present there are only three available useful fashion planning/solutions applications in the market today. These three applications contains some of the similar features we propose. These apps are ClosetSpace, GlamourOutfit and YourCloset.
        </p>
        <p>
            ClosetSpace is similar to our proposed project as it offers the same function of recommending outfits according to the weather, but does not allow the user to choose location and gather outfit suggestions according to that. This app is also accessible through computer and phone. Then, GlamourOutfit another fashion app that allows user to select the type of event, weather and other details the user will provide and then suggests an outfit. However, it requires hours to process outfit recommendations which means users has to input their requests day before their planned events. Lastly, YourCloset, it has many features including virtual closet, outfits and clothes photos/files are also backed up in Google and only accessible in Android phones. YourCloset allows users to plan everyday outfit in calendar, but similar to ClosetSpace, users has to actively spend time on choosing and matching their outfits in the app. It does not actively suggest or recommend any outfits. All these apps have its ups and downs which gave our project the winning edge to be different.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our proposed fashion application is consist of the combined special features of the 3 comparative apps in the market. ‘Noting to Wear’ our fashion application has advantageous features such us, daily outfit recommendation according to weather, location and event – allowing users to plan everyday outfit in calendar with little to less effort by just uploading their collection of clothes through scanning the barcodes/QR codes that comes with the clothes when they users newly purchased it, or scanning the actual clothes themselves. Unlike the combination of 3 similar applications available in the market, we are offering an alternative that is less time consuming, available on the go and help users in reducing their time deciding what to wear.

        <p>
            Our group aims to finish the project within the scheduled timetable, with the same level of quality, within the specified guidelines and hoping to do the best we can with the time we have been given.
            As for our proposed application, by the end of this of this semester we aim to compose a layout of our application in Figma and successfully show how the proposed application should look like. By completing this objective we hope to distribute another survey to confirm the potential consumers’ needs and from there, we will build our application more suitable to users’ taste and needs.

        <p>
            The project idea that the group came up with was a combination of all ideas presented by each member. Catherine’s and Jack’s idea revolved around interactive maps, while Shashika revolved around the fashion industry. So, the group came up with the idea of a fashion app which you can program based on your location and weather (interactive map – Jack and Catherine), then suggesting what appropriate styles and clothes (fashion – Shashika) the user should wear. Initially, the group bounced other couple of ideas – Catherine thought of an interactive safety map, which aims to be used by developers and local councils in improving their shared spaces in accordance to public’s feedback and ensuring the safety of their people. Jack also introduced the idea of having a map that would keep track of people’s location movements in order to help minimize the spread of the virus. This app aims to collect people's location information to identify the hotspots and warn users on their intended travels. However, as we know, shortly after we have discussed this, the government introduced the Covid-Safe app and other similar mobile applications have surfaced. Unfortunately, we could not think of additional features to make our idea stand out. 
</p>
<p>
    So, we decided on fashion, as that is where the money usually flows. We also had another hurdle, Bank joined our group later and we have missed his idea, by the time he joined our group we already settled on the fashion idea. But even so, Bank was very helpful and knowledgeable in enhancing our project idea. Based on the feedbacks gathered from the tutor and lecturer, it was confirmed that the project idea we came up as a group was great and from the researches done by each members, it could even have opportunity to sell in the market as there are only limited application of the same sort is offered and are not even as helpful as we proposed. 
             </p>

<p>
    As a group working collaboratively on this project, we have agreed to divide the parts and work on it on a weekly basis. To successfully conduct this assignment, we communicated hugely using Microsoft teams, we also made a Google document which is available for every group member to view and edit or add their parts. Then, for each week, each member is also assigned with a part and has one week to complete it. The group then conducts a meeting to discuss each part and the possible solutions or ideas that should be included in those areas, collaboratively and as a group. When each member is satisfied and has fully understood the information and the standard of ideas required for their part, they then work individually and complete their assigned part and submit it every end of the week and post in the group feed for feedback.
</p>

<p>
    For the first week, the tasks agreed to be completed on was the Timeline, Tools, Risks, Roles and Testing. It was fair to say that most members have done a good job completing their assigned tasks. Communication was also great, and everyone was very helpful when one has questions or requires additional help in completing their parts. Then, comes week two, the group has to complete Skills and Jobs, Scopes and Limits, Overview, Aims, Tools and Technologies, Plans and Progress, and Group process and career plans. This was a busy week for the team, but as intended, the group had a meeting first agreed on what the information are required for each part then, separate to work independently on them. It was quite challenging for some and did not complete their parts on the date agreed. Third week comes, communication was at it least, the team only communicated during the set meeting, it may be assumed that the team was busy working on each of their assigned tasks. The team also did not meet their deadlines; however, in the end it was still completed. Overall, the process of completing the project was a good experience for the team to learn and know more about each other.

        <p>
            <h5>
                <center> Roles
            </h5>
            </center>
        </p>
        <p><b>Lead Developer</b></p>
        <p>A lead developer has the specific abilities and skills,
            but the most important is the lead developer can act as a leader of the whole project who can mentor, provide general design guidance and encourage the team to exchange ideas in the product’s development stages.
            Which we suggest <b>Catherine</b> to be the lead developer, because she is an amazing leader in our group who guides us to achieve our goals with her organization and leadership skills.
            A lead developer needs someone like her that not only can enhance the internal cohesion in the team, but also improve the efficiency of teamwork. It is no doubt that Catherine is the best member of our group to be the lead developer of the project.
        </p>

        <p><b>Application Developer</b></p>
        <p>As the name suggests, an application developer is someone who creates and tests the applications designed for the project.
            What an application developer needs is good at coding and following the suggestion of the lead developer.
            Therefore, <b>Jack</b> is the one that is able to handle this job. For the reason that Jack tends to be quiet most of the time, but he still delivers up to standard work output.
            He is a flexible person who has a good view on what he is doing. Jack is someone who is capable of overcoming difficulties and solving problems silently and efficiently.
            The position of application developer also gives him a great chance to show his talent of coding.
        </p>

        <p><b>Cyber Security Expert</b></p>
        <p>A cyber security expert is a person who protects the data of our project. Because we are living in the big data era, it is becoming more and more important to protect user data from disclosure.
            A cyber security expert will be able to provide solutions with security issues which will improve the productivity of members in the project and also attract more users.
            <b>Shashika</b> is the person who we assigned for this role. The reason why we chose her to be the cyber security expert is because she is good at this domain of cyber security and her ideal job is to employ in the cyber security field.
            And so she is able to assist users in providing a safe and secure environment.
        </p>

        <p><b>User Interface Designer</b></p>
        <p>User interface is significant because it gives the first impression on the user, it is the key factor of whether the user will continue to use the application or not.
            UI design focuses on the user's visual experience, flexibility and efficiency of use and aesthetics and minimalist design.
            The assignee of this role is <b>Bank</b>. Although his dream job is cloud engineer, he still has interest in designing staff.
            He uses many mobile and PC applications, which gives him some experience of UI design. And also Bank is learning User-centred Design that may make a big difference on designing user interface for this project application.

            <h5>
                <center> Scopes and Limits
            </h5>
            </center>
        </p>
<h6>Scopes</h6>
<p>
Noting to wear application has two main scopes which fashionable young ladies can choose outfits with the help of this application for two situations. Weather and events are the reasons where most people must choose their outfits. Fashionable ladies face this problem more often as they get confused when they think what to wear as the situation stands out. Features such as dressing the avatar give more help to choose outfits with confidence for the users. More features give more help and it makes it easy for the users on the go.
</p>
<h6>Choosing what to wear according to the weather</h6>
<p>
    The main scope of the application is helping young ladies to maintain their fashions with their own closet while adapting to the weather changes and events. Clothes which you buy or which you already have in your closet will be uploaded to the application to decide what you should wear according to the weather conditions by encouraging users to allow the location. Uploading the clothes you already have by their barcode will be an additional feature where you can maintain your closet at the same time. The application will go through the clothes which are in the system and give you a result to wear according to the current weather.
</p>
<h6>Choosing what to wear according to the event</h6>
<p>
    Planning outfits for events which users create through their calendar is another main feature this application consists of. The application connects with the calendar and decides the best outfit according to the weather and event both. Fashionable ladies always give extra effort to give their best appearance for events such as casual, evening, date nights etc. This application helps those ladies by giving the best outfit according to the database and cheering the user in no time.

</p>
<h6>Function of an avatar to check the outfit compatibility</h6>
<p>
    Avatar will be used to dress the outfits which are in the system and users can check how fashionable they look as per their own taste. This avatar can be changed according to your taste such as skin complexion, body type, face, hair etc. These settings will give the users to change the avatar according to their body types and feel that they are dressing themselves to check the outfits on the go. This feature helps users to match outfits before trying the outfits in real and make users more comfortable with their own choices.
</p>
<h6>Virtual Closet Tour</h6>
<p>
    Users can have their own closet in Noting to wear application where users can remove and add clothing pieces. Users can have different sections for their clothes like a real wardrobe. Users can have a virtual closet tour which can be used to get a better picture to know what they have in their real closet. Users can change the closet settings such as closet type, background, section etc as their taste. Users will love this feature as they can use this to match the outfits they have already and make decisions such as buying new clothes to add up to match more.

</p>
<h6>Outfit Suggestions</h6>
<p>
    Outfit suggestion feature comes using the databases such as user history, user location, future events etc. Previous selected outfits make it easy for the application to get a good idea about the taste of the user to create suggestions. This feature will suggest two main suggestions for users which consists of more matched outfits to try on and new outfits that can add to user closets. It helps users to expand their real wardrobe with more clothes and match more clothes to create more stylish outfits. 

</p>
<h6>Limits</h6>
<p>
    There are limits for every application which we want to expand our creation with new ideas but where limitations come into reality. Successful applications can expand to new idea implementations to help users more in the process. In the initial stage, the main scope is the most important to create the application and get an own identity itself to gain more new users. Compared to other established competitive applications, there will be more limitations that we can not follow in our initial stage with costs and lack of experience in the industry. But it will be great to have a good picture of our limits to attract more users in near future.

</p>
<h6>Feature for shopping clothes</h6>
<p>
    Users will be happy to have a shopping feature in one click away while they match their outfits through the application. This feature will drag the attraction of most clothing companies as they can gain sales from the users of the application. There should be a steady user base to implement this feature as it should gain sales for the companies who are going to sell in the shopping section of the application. Because of that, this feature should be added in the future after gaining a steady user group who uses the application regularly.

</p>
<h6>Creating the avatar with real face of the user</h6>
<p>
    Users will be happy to dress their avatar with their real clothes which they own. Also, the users will be thrilled to have an avatar which defines themselves. Creating an avatar with the real face of the user will be the solution to implement the avatar. Real photo of the user will need to upload to the application and it will make the face of the avatar by using that photograph.  But this will cost more to do in the initial stage, and it will complicate the project while developing. Because of that this feature should be added in the future to develop the avatar to give a nice feature for the application.

           <ul>Our project allows user to add their clothes collections through the QR codes which are attached on the clothes. Therefore, a software which can scan and read QR code is required. We choose the Kaspersky's QR Scanner for this project. Because of the process of outfits input, on the hardware side, a mobile phone with camera is necessary for each user. Before giving the wear suggestion to the users, our app also need to collect the location of the user where they would attend. This location is used for analyzing whether the outfits are appropriate for the occasion and the weather. Hence, we need the licenses of Google map, because it is one of the most excellent map applications in the world. In our project, we also recommend users use AR (Augmented Reality) devices such as Google Glass and Microsoft HoloLens. They can improve the users experience by helping them try on their outfits with the AR devices, even the users do not own the outfits in reality, they still can try on with the AR devices.</ul>
           <br>
           <center> <img src="AR pokemongo.jpg" alt="idea" width="500" height="300"> </center>

           <h6>AR technologies:</h6>
           <ul>Augmented reality (AR) has long sounded like a wild, futuristic concept, but the technology has been around for years. All the group members remember the movie scene that Tony Stark (from the movie: Iron Man) used hand to hold up the virtual staffs and throw them all around his lab in the air. “It was pretty cool!” We had the same feeling. Surprisingly, this technology has come to reality for many years. In 2016, a game called Pokémon GO attracted people of all ages and both sexes. We can remember clearly the days which people held their phone’s camera to find the game staff around the park in the reality, and that was AR technology. Also, a lot of AR devices like Google Glass and Microsoft HoloLens have launched these years. Through the AR devices products advertising, our group members were amazed at the effect that AR connects the real world and the virtual，and we believed that AR devices can greatly enhance the users experience when they try on the outfits by it.</ul>

        <p>
            Our product is aiming to help people find what to wear fashionably in their daily lives, so the wear suggestions given are principal activities in this project. Our product is offered to the general public of all ages, and every one of them has their own appetite for fashion choices. The thing we should test is whether our product’s fashion sense caters to different users ‘tastes. To find out whether we are building the right product, the user’s satisfaction degree to the wear suggestions is what we need to test. Hence, there is our user testing plan.

                <center> Risks
            </h5>
            </center>
        </p>
<p>
Risks are the facts that discourages a project where the team members must face and overcome it. Decisions make risks more powerful and sometimes avoid them without any problem. Developing an application is not an easy task but not a task which we cannot achieve with the right products and people. Unfortunately, there are some risks that we will have to face while developing our project as team members.
</p>
<h6>Choosing the Application Developer</h6>
        <p>
Choosing the app developer is the biggest risk for the app as this decision will impact the whole project itself. Wrong App Developer can ruin the whole project in a minute, and it will be a disaster to face as a team who are developing an application. We should consider more about the quality of the work of the App developer before choosing him for the project and we should not rely on cost more at this stage.       


        </p>
<p>
    App developer who is interested in the fashion industry can make wonders as he knows how the industry works. It would be great if we choose a person with prior experience who worked with similar applications. Checking on his client references and work portfolio will give us a brief idea about his work such as UX skills which is very important while developing an application. A person with good relationship skills is a must because all the team members should interact with him while working. Choosing the right application developer will be the wise decision to make for the success of the application.
</p>
<h6> Data Security </h6>
        <p>
Data is the most important aspect in the tech industry where the security of data breaches most of the time. Data of the project should be more secure without getting any chance of leaking them outside. Project data is sensitive, and all team members should work to protect them with responsibility and care throughout the process. Also, data of the users must be protected in the long and should implement a better security plan for the application.

        </p>
<p>
    Trust among the team members is the most important while working for a project as a team. Giving information outside breaks the trust of the team and will lead to failure of the application itself. For that as a team everyone should work with responsibility on their own tasks with care. Risk of data security of users should be overcome by enhancing more security strategies such as OpenID Connect, Oauth2 for safe logins. Also, encryption systems and security layers should be implemented to secure the users while using the application. App integration, Anti debugging will help more to secure the data of the app users for the developers when they develop the application. 
</p>

<h6>Losing Data</h6>
        <p>
Risk of losing data due to hardware failures and system malfunctions can result in losing productivity results of the project. Power failures, overheating and hardware faults can affect hardware failures to occur. Losing data without backups is the worst thing that can happen to a team where we loss all the data we have without any trace of it. It will make the process long and start again as a team while costing more money and time on the long process.
    </p>
<p>
    Hardware should be updated and maintained regularly to minimise hardware failures. Backing up data minimises the risk and replicating data to the cloud have more advantages. Hybrid cloud backup is the best option anyone can use where it backs up the data in the cloud and on the site at the same time. It will secure the data of the project and as a team we do not have to worry as we have a backup up to date to use at any time.
</p>
<h6>Incompatibility and Human Errors</h6>
 <p>
There will be incompatibilities with the project idea and the real application while developing the application which result in the malfunctions in the project itself. Human errors while implementing the project such as interpreting wrong idea to the developer will make things worse as the whole application will direct to another end. Also, application compatibilities with android and iPhone should be included into the project idea while implementing as there are various kinds of users in the cyber world.

    Team members should recheck their work and should discuss with other members to give the best idea to the application developer who plays the main role in creating the application. Application compatibility with Android and iPhone should be considered by app developers and the human errors which happen in the team while implementing the application should be monitored regularly to avoid any errors to implement the application step by step.
</p>
<h6>User Group</h6>
<p>
    Developing an application for the wrong target users is a nightmare that can have as a project itself. If the chosen target user group refuses the app, it will be one of the biggest risks that can happen to a project after creating the application because it costs the money and hard work which the whole team spent through the process. Also, it will be the failure of the application in the first place.
</p>
<p>
    To avoid this risk, we should consider more about our targeted users and see from their perspective. It will attract the targeted user group to the app and the app will satisfy them gaining more users. User group should be considered more while the discussions on the project idea and while developing the application as well because without the user it will be a failure. In the project idea, as team members we should give more time and consideration to get the big picture of the user group we are working on and we should give that idea to our application developer to make the application a success.

            In order to capture communication that isn’t recorded formally, a better way is to record all voice messages and text messages, which can be used to form up Fill out a form of meeting minutes.
            And also make sure everyone in the team has contributed in meetings such as exchanging ideas on certain parts of the project.
            As usual, meetings will take place in Microsoft Team every Thursday or Friday.

        <p>
            In addition, if a group member does not respond to communications, we will send a direct message to this member asking him what he is doing and whether he is available to come and join the meeting or not.
            The frequency of our team meeting is maintained at twice a week outside class times, sometimes three or four times a week is not impossible.
            Because we are a team with four members, it is important to exchange ideas, help each other when someone gets into trouble and complete the assignment together.
