Hence, why she pursued to learn more about it.

<p> <h5> <center> Roles </h5> </center> </p>
    <p><b>Lead Developer</b></p>
    <p>A lead developer has the specific abilities and skills,
        but the most important is the lead developer can act as a leader of the whole project who can mentor, provide general design guidance and encourage the team to exchange ideas in the product’s development stages.
        Which we suggest <b>Catherine</b> to be the lead developer, because she is an amazing leader in our group who guides us to achieve our goals with her organization and leadership skills.
        A lead developer needs someone like her that not only can enhance the internal cohesion in the team, but also improve the efficiency of teamwork. It is no doubt that Catherine is the best member of our group to be the lead developer of the project.
    </p>

    <p><b>Application Developer</b></p>
    <p>As the name suggests, an application developer is someone who creates and tests the applications designed for the project.
        What an  application developer needs is good at coding and following the suggestion of the lead developer.
        Therefore, <b>Jack</b> is the one that is able to handle this job. For the reason that Jack tends to be quiet most of the time, but he still delivers up to standard work output.
        He is a flexible person who has a good view on what he is doing. Jack is someone who is capable of overcoming difficulties and solving problems silently and efficiently.
        The position of application developer also gives him a great chance to show his talent of coding.
    </p>

    <p><b>Cyber Security Expert</b></p>
    <p>A cyber security expert is a person who protects the data of our project. Because we are living in the big data era, it is becoming more and more important to protect user data from disclosure.
        A cyber security expert will be able to provide solutions with security issues which will improve the productivity of members in the project and also attract more users.
        <b>Shashika</b> is the person who we assigned for this role. The reason why we chose her to be the cyber security expert is because she is good at this domain of cyber security and her ideal job is to employ in the cyber security field.
        And so she is able to assist users in providing a safe and secure environment.
    </p>

    <p><b>User Interface Designer</b></p>
    <p>User interface is significant because it gives the first impression on the user, it is the key factor of whether the user will continue to use the application or not.
        UI design focuses on the user's visual experience, flexibility and efficiency of use and aesthetics and minimalist design.
        The assignee of this role is <b>Bank</b>. Although his dream job is cloud engineer, he still has interest in designing staff.
        He uses many mobile and PC applications, which gives him some experience of UI design. And also Bank is learning User-centred Design that may make a big difference on designing user interface for this project application.

<p> <h5> <center> Risks </h5> </center> </p>



<p> 



Risks are the facts that discourages a project where the team members must face and overcome it. Decisions make risks more powerful and sometimes avoid them without any problem. Developing an application is not an easy task but not a task which we cannot achieve with right products and people. Unfortunately, there are some risks that we will have to face while developing our project as team members.



</p>



<p>



Biggest risk of developing applications is the targeted users who does not want the application. If the chosen target user group refuses the app, it will be the biggest risk that can happen to a project. To avoid this risk, we should consider more about our targeted users and see from their perspective. It will attract the targeted user group to the app and the app will satisfy them gaining more users.



</p>



<p>



Choosing the app developer is another risk for the app as this decision will impact the whole project itself. Wrong App Developer can ruin whole project in a minute, and it will be a disaster to face as a team who are developing an application. We should consider more about the quality of the work of the App developer before choosing him for the project and we should not rely on cost more at this stage.



</p>



<p>



Risk of data security should overcome by enhancing more security strategies such as OpenID Connect, Oauth2 for safe logins. Also, encryption systems and security layers should be implemented to secure the users while using the application. App integration, Anti debugging will help more to secure the data of the app users for the developers when they develop the application.
