            <p>
                Lenjie, more known by her second name “Catherine” is born and bred in Philippines. She moved to Australia in 2015 to be reunited with her parents. Her hobbies include, cooking, hiking, and playing board games. When she was in Year 7-10, she learned the basics of HTML, she has also been a contender for some IT quiz bowls in her school. But despite all the exposure to IT, she was never really interested in it, as she only sees it as another subject to pass and another extracurricular activity to boost up her grades. Her interest in IT sparked when she met her stepfather, who is a Security Data Architect. She further realised how massive the influence of IT is in all areas of jobs. Hence, why she pursued to learn more about it.

                    <p>Assignment 2 was a success, although we lost park in only one part which has taught us valuable lessons as we move on to Assignment 3. In Assignment 2, we divided the work equally and worked in them independently. Now, in Assignment 3 we realised how important working as a group and discussing topics and tasks as a group is. So, now before working individually on each of our assigned tasks, we discuss what the task is asking first and the information that it requires and what we expect as a group to see written on those parts. This change in our process has proved to be really helpful as we worked through finishing assignment 3.

                        The common aspect in the group’s ideal job is that they all touch on with IT. All the jobs involve analysing data, though for different purposes. Catherine analyzes human resourcing and workplace data while the other three involve internet and cyber data. Across the group, the minimum qualification for the job is the same except for the HR Consultant which requires some business and management knowledge.

            </p>
            <p> Git repository has been a helpful instrument in completing this project. Through Git, we were able to identify who modified the codes, who added their work and which part they have changed and what time they have submitted their work. We also learned from assignment two how cloning and keeping a master copy to our selves helps in not messing up the code and not losing someone else’s work when two or more members of the group commit to change at the same time. Git is also an easy to use as the platform. It is simple to understand, even for someone that does not really have deep knowledge in IT.
